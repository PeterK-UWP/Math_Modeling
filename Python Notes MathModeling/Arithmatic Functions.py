# mathematical functions

# if a is negative, you get a complex number
x = (-1.5) ** 2.3
print(x)

# round down x//y
# 16//3 = 5
# -16//3 =-4

# gives remainder, numerator of fraction
# x%y   5/3 = 1 * 2/3  the remainder is 2
# 5 % 3
# print(x)
# make sure y is an integer.


# swap numbers
x, y = 2, 3
print(x, y)
x, y = y, x
print(x, y)
