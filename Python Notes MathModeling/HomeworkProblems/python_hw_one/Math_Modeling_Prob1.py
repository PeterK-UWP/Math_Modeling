# question 1
# gnu plot sin(x) and taylor expansion of sin(x)
# input: f(x) = sin(x)
#        g(x) = x - (x**3)/(3!) + (x**5)/(5!) - (x**7)/(7!)
#        plot [0:pi] f(x), g(x)

# question 2
# plot x**7 - 5*x +1 = 0, and get its roots
# there are 3 roots: [-1.5:1], [0:0.5], [1:1.5]
# [-1.5:1] = -1.3386
# [0:0.5]  =  0.2000
# [1:1.5]  =  1.2708
