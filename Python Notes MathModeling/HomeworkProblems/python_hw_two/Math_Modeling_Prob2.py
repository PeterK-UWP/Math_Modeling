# problem 1 (listsvsarrays): good
# Consider a list a and an array b, each consisting of the ordered set (1,2,3). Write a
# Python program that generates a and b. Then ask the program to print 2a and 2b.
# What is the difference? Also print 2a + 1 and 2b + 1 to see what happens.

# problem 2 (matrixmult): good
# matrix multiplication

# problem 3 (twoAplus3): good
# do 2A + 3  A is in problem 2

# problem 4 (3by3times3by2): rectify
# 3x3 * 3x2
#                          [row 1 column 1, row 1 column 2
#                           row 2 column 1, row 2 column 2
#                           row 3 column 1, row 3 column 2]


# problem 5 (rootsqrtdatafile): good
# Generate a data file with integers 1 to 10, one per line. Then write a Python program
# that reads this data file and evaluates and prints their root-mean-square

# problem 6 (geometricmean): good
# Using the functions sum and len in Python, write a program that calculates and prints the geometric mean
# of the integers 1 to 10. How does this mean compare to the arithmetic mean of these numbers?

# problem 7 (5by5matrix): good
# Generate a 5 ×5 zero matrix. Then using a nesting “for” loop, convert it to a unit
# matrix.

# problem 8 (energylevels): good
# get the degeneracy for a quantum system, (code from quantum class)

# problem 9 (madelungconstant): good
# Write a Python program that calculates the approximate value of the Madelung
# constant for sodium chloride structure from, l = 10, 50, 100

# problem 10 (wavelengths): good/ check
# use rydberg equation to get first 3 series of wavelengths n1 = 1, 2, 3, n2 appropriately

# problem 11 (trigvalues): help
# Write a Python program to generate a data file with three columns as follows: The
# first column containing values of x in the range of 0 to 2π in 20 steps and the second and
# third columns the corresponding values of y = sin x and z = cos x, respectively.

# problem 12 (plottingtrigvalues): help
# Write a Python program to read the data file generated in the previous problem and
# plot y versus x, and z versus x on the same diagram.
